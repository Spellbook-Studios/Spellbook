## Using Spellbook
**Game Engine** You can use our own game editor [Arcana](https://github.com/Spellbook-Studios/Arcana), which is based upon Spellbook and uses it for both developing the game and runs with Spellbook at runtime.

**Library** You can also use Spellbook directly as a [Java library](https://github.com/Spellbook-Studios/Spellbook/packages/1788482). **TODO: Instructions coming soon**

*With love, Sebastian :heart:*
